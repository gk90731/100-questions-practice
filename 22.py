d = {"a" : list(range(1,11)),"b" : list(range(11,21)),"c" : list(range(21,31))}
print(d)


#Exercise for reference:

#Create a dictionary of keys a, b, c where each key has as value a list from 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and 21 to 30 respectively. Then print out the dictionary in a nice format.

#Answer:

#from pprint import pprint

#d = dict(a = list(range(1, 11)), b = list(range(11, 21)), c = list(range(21, 31)))
#pprint(d)
#Explanation:

#We're using ranges here to construct the lists. We're also using the built-in Python pprint  module which is used to print out well formatted views of datatypes in Python.
